### Hi there 👋, my name is Florianne Che
#### I am CS student @ UIC

I love learning and teaching! My past experiences and projects include volunteer tutoring & building educational resources, including the app I am building for the Leaf Project to enhance financial literacy for women. Right now I am working on an AI Directory website designed to provide students with learning and homework resources. When I'm not programming, I love to read, write poetry, train for my upcoming half-marathon, and draw comics! I am so excited to be another addition to the community of women in tech. 

Skills: JAVA / PYTHON / SWIFT / C++ / JS / HTML / CSS
