### Hi there! ‚ú© üåä My name is Florianne Che
I love designing, learning, and building meaningful technology! This past May I interned with the UIC Innovation Center to solve the problem-statement of collecting rural healthcare patients' feedback. My group of five interns led the research, ideation, and prototyping process to build a Figma-mockup of a survey and data analysis dashboard. 

After that, I spent the summer as a student researching with the Learning Sciences Research Institute as a web developer for their teacher authoring tool. 

These experiences have given exposed to the world of human-centered design and research, and given me the opportunity to develop my front-end dev skills. I'm excited to continue building accessible technology and work towards becoming full-stack software developer.

### Projects
* As the WiCS Dev Lead, I'm leading a group of 16 students to **develop a website** called the **UIC CS Course Planner**; this tool will help students plan out their required CS courses and electives for their four-year plan. We are using HTML/CSS/JS, React.js, and Node.js to develop this tool.
* I am building a **financial literacy mobile app** for the student-led Leaf Project. This app aims to educate users with missions-based learning and a community page that connectsthem with other learners on the app. I have been learning Swift since my to help develop 7/8 of our app's pages and, as of Fall 2024, am instructing our new wave of front-end developers. 
* I finished my **personal website** over the summer 2024 to develop my web-design skills and showcase my various projects. Visit the link in my bio to check out my summer project!


### About Me
