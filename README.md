### Hi there ✩ 🌊
### My name is Florianne Che
### Web Dev & Mobile Dev

I love designing, learning, and building meaningful technology! My past experiences and projects include volunteer tutoring & building educational resources, including the app I am building for the Leaf Project to enhance financial literacy for women. 

Right now I am working on my personal website to develop my web design skills and showcase my various projects. When I'm not programming, I love to read classic literature, run, and draw comics! I am so excited to be another addition to the community of women in tech. 

- 🌨️ I’m working on building my personal website

- 🎐 Fun fact: I'm reading The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck
